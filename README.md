#Abstract
For this term project we propose our solution to the specified sorting problem for the provided apparatus by way of a microcontroller. The variety of parts to be sorted and were differentiated and processed using apparatus components sequentially. The apparatus consists of a conveyor belt, stepper motor and multiple sensors. Each of these systems were implemented over the span of the course. The challenge ultimately was the implementation of these systems in the sorting code to achieve the specified requirements.

The software and hardware interfacing are detailed to outline the solution of the project challenge. Specifically, the MCU interface with the various apparatus components is displayed along with a discussion of the sorting algorithm and its implementation. 

Our solution to this problem is outlined and discussed within certain limitations and conventions of the apparatus and environment. The results of the solution are analyzed and discussed to provide some insight on how the solution could be improved for the future.
